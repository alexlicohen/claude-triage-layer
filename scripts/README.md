## `triage-usage.sh` — deterministic per-tier token tally

Replaces the orchestrator eyeballing per-subagent token counts and summing them from
memory (see `triage.md` § Usage tally). Deterministic, read-only, offline.

```
Usage: triage-usage.sh [-v] [PATH]
```

Prints one rubric line:

```
Usage: haiku Nk · sonnet Nk · opus Nk · fable Nk (orchestrator excluded; /usage for quota)
```

With `-v`, also prints a per-agent breakdown table (agentId, tier, model family,
peak-context, cumulative output/input/cache-read).

### What it reads

Claude Code writes every spawned subagent's full transcript next to the main session
transcript:

```
~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-id>.jsonl              # orchestrator — EXCLUDED
~/.claude/projects/<slug>/<session-id>/subagents/
    agent-<agentId>.jsonl                                 # one subagent transcript
    agent-<agentId>.meta.json                             # {agentType, description, toolUseId, spawnDepth}
```

- Subagent assistant lines carry `.message.model` (`claude-opus-4-8`, `claude-fable-5`,
  `claude-sonnet-5`, `claude-haiku-*`, …) and
  `.message.usage {input_tokens, output_tokens, cache_creation_input_tokens, cache_read_input_tokens}`.
- The orchestrator's own turns live only in `<session-id>.jsonl` (they are `isSidechain:false`)
  and are **never counted** — hence "orchestrator excluded".
- `agent-<id>.meta.json` supplies `agentType` (the tier name, e.g. `triage-deep-reasoner`),
  used only for the human-readable `-v` breakdown.

`PATH` may be a session `.jsonl`, a session directory, a `subagents/` directory, or a
project directory (newest `*.jsonl` is used). Omitted → newest `*.jsonl` in
`~/.claude/projects/<slug-of-$PWD>` (the current session).

### What it counts, and why

For each subagent it takes the **peak context** the agent reached:

```
peak = max over assistant turns of (input_tokens + cache_creation_input_tokens + cache_read_input_tokens)
```

then attributes that peak to the model family of the peak turn and sums per family.

**Why this number.** It equals the per-subagent token figure Claude Code itself displays
(the context-window occupancy at the run's high-water mark). Verified against two known
runs in this repo's development session: a Fable code-review reached `64917` (~66k) and an
Opus principles-extraction run reached `98443` (~98k) — exactly the numbers the human
operator observed. Because a subagent's context grows monotonically, `peak == last turn`
in practice; `peak` is used for robustness against a small/compacted final turn.

Candidate metrics that were rejected because they do **not** reproduce the observed
per-agent numbers: `output + non-cached input` gave 77k/55k for those two runs (the ~98k
run is mostly re-read context, so any metric excluding `cache_read` undercounts it by
~45%); cumulative-across-turns totals ran to 0.8M–2.6M (they re-count the cached history
every turn).

### Limits (read before trusting the number)

- **It is a relative per-tier cost proxy, not billing.** It is dominated by
  `cache_read_input_tokens` (each turn re-reads the agent's accumulated context + system
  prompt + tool defs from cache, which is billed at a large discount). For authoritative
  quota/spend use `/usage` — as the rubric line itself says.
- **Cache reads ARE included** (they are part of the context the agent occupied). If you
  want new-tokens-only, that is not what this reports.
- **Cumulative output is not in the headline** (it is shown in `-v` as `CUM_OUT`). A
  high-output agent — e.g. Fable emitting a long review — is therefore *undercounted* by
  the headline; check `CUM_OUT` in `-v` when output cost matters.
- **Live sessions grow.** Running mid-session counts subagents in progress; totals rise as
  those agents append. The result is deterministic for a given on-disk state.
- **Per-family attribution uses the transcript's `model` field** (ground truth), so a
  read-only reviewer running on Opus is counted under `opus`, matching its actual model.

### Fail-loud behaviour

| Condition | Result | Exit |
|---|---|---|
| Success | rubric line (+ table with `-v`) | 0 |
| Bad flag / non-`.jsonl` file / too many args | error to stderr | 1 |
| Path does not exist | error | 2 |
| Default project dir unresolvable / no `*.jsonl` | error | 3 |
| Transcript empty / unreadable | error | 4 |
| No subagent transcripts, or all unparseable | `INCOMPLETE:` message | 5 |
| `jq` not installed | error | 6 |

A tier legitimately at 0 (no subagent of that model spawned) is reported as `0` — a real
measurement, distinct from the `INCOMPLETE` case, which never prints zeros as if measured.

### Requirements

`bash` (3.2+, i.e. macOS default — no bash-4 features) and `jq`. No GNU-only flags.
